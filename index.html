                    <P>My maiden name is Karla Ivonne Sa&#769enz Villagra&#769n and talking
                    about myself and my likes is a very difficult task, as many things 
                    bring me joy, I think once I start those categories could be
                    endless. For purpose of this assignment I will describe 
                    a few of those.  I have picked what I think are my favorite
                    pastimes.
                    </P>
                    <ul><li class="subtitle">Painting</li>
                            <p>I like this discipline as pastime, doing it and 
                                admiring the work of other artists. The vision
                            each human being has on one's surroundings is incredible.
                        It is the reflection of our own selves on a canvas. 
                      </p>
                        <li class="subtitle">Traveling</li>
                        <p>One of the hobbies we have as a family is traveling.
                           As incredible as it might seem to some people, it requires 
                           a lot of planning, work, and it might be strenuous, but the 
                           reward is worth all the work.  Being able to discover new 
                           places, what includes new people, foods, traditions and just 
                           the pleasure to open up to new experiences is one of the 
                           most rewarding feelings there is.
                        </p>
                        <li class="subtitle">Coding and Mathematics</li>
                        <p>
                            I included these two disciplines together because they have so 
                            much in common.  The analysis is the drive of both.  It is 
                            like having a puzzle and finding a way to solve it.  Might be 
                            a little of a detective inside of me.  I could have added 
                            solving puzzles, as some of the things I enjoy more in life,
                            Investigation, analysis, and solving a task are the food of
                            my inquisitive mind.  
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I think it is safe to say that I could reduce all the things I like 
                        in a few words: discovery, investigate, and solutions.  I have an 
                        analytical mind.  Every day is special to me if that means to learn
                        something new.  I think that discovering something new makes each 
                        day worth living.  To experience life is the most amazing thing a 
                        human being has.  Enjoying the simple things, and the extraordinary 
                        the same way. Life is not perfect, but that imperfection makes it 
                        extraordinary.  My greatest passion: Life.
